# Reign
### Project Information

Reign is a multiplayer, 2D sandbox game built with Java and LibGDX.

## Features

1) Multiplayer networking utilizing UDP. Packets are sent between the client and server in realtime to provide a multiplayer game-play experience.


2) User opens game to log-in screen. After entering a username and ip address of the server, the user is logged into the game with realtime information reflecting the update.

## What I Learned
I initially tried using TCP sockets, but realized the protocol was much too slow. I got to learn all about UDP sockets and how packets can be sent to create networked games like this! In addition, I got to learn the LibGDX framework from scratch.


## Current Plans
Movement and log-in packets have been implemented and block placement packets will be next.
